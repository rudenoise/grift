# Grift (Graphs + Swift)

This is a library for creating, manipulating, querying and
persisting Graph Data using the Swift programming language.

Developed and tested on Linux (Ubuntu 16.04) using Swift 3 (Preview
6).

The library has basic types for _vertices_ and _edges_ and uses
JSON to persist graphs.
